# Artifact & Sign-off Map

> Third onboarding building block. Closes the loop: **what to build** ([`bootstrap-prep.en.md`](./bootstrap-prep.en.md)) → **how to integrate** ([`integration-discovery.en.md`](./integration-discovery.en.md)) → **which artifacts, with whom, which rules** (this document).

![Customer onboarding flow: three checklists → artifacts with sign-off roles → 7 rule sinks → autonomous team](../assets/onboarding-flow.en.png)

## Purpose

At bootstrap the framework ships a **standard set of artifacts and templates** (specs, backlog, architecture design doc, security, data protection …). But every customer has their own, often unwritten enterprise rules — how specs are phrased, that log files must be produced in an audit-ready way, which data-protection rules apply.

This map is the **reconciliation and sign-off plan**: it lists every framework artifact, says where it lives, when it is needed, **with whom on the customer side it is reconciled/signed off**, and **where the resulting rule is stored**. The result is a complete enterprise rule set anchored in the right places — the precondition for an autonomous team of 3–4 people to subsequently develop in a compliant way on their own.

## How to use it

1. **Filter:** Delete non-triggered rows (see *When needed* column). A lean solution without PII, without AI, without third-party systems, "loose" → few rows.
2. **Plan workshops:** Group rows by *Sign-off role* → one session per role. "Sit down with data protection, walk through all DP artifacts."
3. **Reconcile:** Per artifact ask: *Do you have your own specification?* — If yes → reconcile, customer rule wins. If no → framework default applies.
4. **Anchor:** Write the reconciliation result as a rule into the named **rule sink**.
5. **Track status:** open → in clarification → signed off.

## Rule sinks (where rules are stored)

| Sink | Content |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project-wide top-level rules, version history |
| `CONVENTIONS.md` | Governance mode, strictness (loose/normal/strict), active gates, story/spec conventions |
| `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` §5 | Active quality dimensions + add-ons (e.g. logging/monitoring/audit readiness) |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security rules, threat-model result |
| `dpo/controls/` + DP artifacts | Legal basis, DPIA, record of processing, deletion concept, TOMs |
| `.claude/environment.json` | Paths, available tools, sovereignty/proxy routing |
| `DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md` | Handover knowledge for autonomous teams / tool switches |
| Backlog tool (Linear/M365/GitHub) | Definition of Done, story format |

## Sign-off roles (customer side)

Derived from [`integration-discovery.en.md`](./integration-discovery.en.md) (RACI, contacts) and [`bootstrap-prep.en.md`](./bootstrap-prep.en.md) (IT / business / management):

- **Sponsor** — client / management
- **Domain owner** — business unit / subject matter side
- **Customer IT / architect** — technical specifications, platform, integration
- **Security** — CISO / security officer
- **Data protection** — DPO / data protection officer
- **Operations** — ops / platform operations
- **Audit** — internal audit / compliance
- **Design/Brand** — brand specifications (colors, frontend design, CI guidelines)

> **Role entry points (lenses).** Four of these roles have narrative entry-point runbooks that explain the framework from their point of view — what it means for them, which gatekeepers apply, where they take control: [`ciso-security.en.md`](../runbooks/ciso-security.en.md) (security), [`dpo-privacy.en.md`](../runbooks/dpo-privacy.en.md) (data protection), [`cto-code-quality.en.md`](../runbooks/cto-code-quality.en.md) (code quality), [`ceo-business-case.en.md`](../runbooks/ceo-business-case.en.md) (managing director).

### DESIGN.md pattern (lean architecture)

To keep `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` lean and design details in *one* place:

- As soon as the solution has a **frontend/UI**, `§5` of the architecture doc **always** adds a reference to a `DESIGN.md`.
- **No specifications?** → `DESIGN.md` explicitly states "no special specifications" (do not omit it — the deliberate statement is itself the rule).
- **Specifications exist?** → colors, typography, component rules live in `DESIGN.md` (format compatible with `design-md-generator` / `lumen-visual-system`).
- The **Design/Brand** role signs off the content; without a frontend the row is simply *n/a*.

## Trigger linkage (path to later auto-generation)

The *When needed* column hangs off already-existing bootstrap answers. Evaluated manually today, machine-evaluated later:

| Trigger source | Activates |
|---|---|
| `bootstrap-prep` question 7 — personal data | Section C (legal basis, DPIA, record, deletion concept, TOMs) |
| `bootstrap-prep` question 7 — AI component | AI / EU AI Act documentation |
| `bootstrap-prep` question 7 — regulated industry | Compliance evidence mechanism, audit perspective |
| `bootstrap-prep` question 8 — "strict" | Threat model, four-eyes, audit trail |
| `bootstrap-prep` question 3 — web frontend | Design/CI specifications (frontend), performance dimension |
| `integration-discovery` cluster 3 — interfaces | Integration / deploy model, threat model |
| `integration-discovery` cluster 6 — compliance/audit | Logging/monitoring dimension, audit perspective |
| `bootstrap-prep` add-on — monitoring | Monitoring / logging setup |

> **Lightweight principle:** Only triggered rows appear in the project instance. Anything not triggered is not asked and creates no operator overhead.
