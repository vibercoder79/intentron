# INTENTRON — Document Index

[🇩🇪 Deutsch](./INDEX.md) · [🇬🇧 English](./INDEX.en.md)

This index lists **all documents** of the framework in one place — not the generated artifacts (`.excalidraw`/`.png`), not the `specs/`, and not the release notes (`docs/releases/`). Read it as a map: the first table opens up the actual documentation (handbook, runbooks, ADRs, onboarding, references), the second the skill documentation. All paths are relative to `docs/`. Back to the entry page: [README](../README.md).

The **Languages** column shows whether a document is bilingual (`DE+EN`) or German-only (`DE`). The English twin sits next to the German file as `<name>.en.md`.
