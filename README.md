# INTENTRON — AI-Driven Development Governance
### by OWLIST

> **License:** Source-available (PolyForm Perimeter 1.0.0) — usable and adaptable for your own projects, **no reselling**. ([details](#license))

> A **battle-tested, tool-neutral governance framework** for AI-assisted development — reference implementation in Claude Code, runs equally with Codex, Cursor and other AI tools. An interview-driven orchestrator plus a coherent set of sub-skills set up a complete AI-driven development governance framework for any new project, covering the full delivery cycle.

**Core idea:** AI writes your code. Governance makes sure you still understand why in six months.

INTENTRON turns the method described in Matthias Schrader's book "Code Crash" into a working operating system for AI-assisted development.

**The name — INTENT + -TRON:** *Intent* is Schrader's core idea — we extend spec-driven development by the layer *above* the spec: every story is aligned to an **intent** (the *why*), not just a specification (the *what*). The *-tron* suffix names a **machine** (cyclotron, magnetron). Together, INTENTRON is **the engine that turns intent into production** — enforced and traceable.

---

## Why INTENTRON? The edge

Most spec-driven frameworks (Spec Kit & co.) optimize exactly one thing: turning a specification into code. Quality, governance, security, privacy, team-readiness — they leave those out. INTENTRON flips the focus: the generated code is not the product, the *path from intent to production* is — with guardrails a team would otherwise have to build itself.

Four things set us apart concretely:

1. **One contract — tool-neutral and machine-executable.** Your rules (tests, logging, security thresholds, governance) live in *one* place and are shared by three readers: the human, the AI tool (Claude, Codex, Cursor) and the CI that enforces them. Others have rules as prose that nobody enforces — and lock you into *one* tool.
2. **Intent before implementation.** We start one step earlier than the spec — at the *why* (after Schrader). That stops the AI from cleanly building the wrong thing.
3. **Governance that scales with you.** Solo gets three gates, an enterprise gets twelve — same record, only the strictness is dialed up or down.
4. **Privacy & security in the bundle.** DPO and security-architect reviews are built in, not an afterthought. For regulated industries that's the entry ticket.

**Common denominator:** Others optimize "the AI writes code." We optimize "a team — human plus *any* AI — gets intent to production, with guardrails it didn't have to build itself." The guardrails are invisible until they catch something — and when they catch, they explain why.

**Faster *and* compliant — vs. plain vibe engineering.** Vibe engineering ships fast, but nobody guarantees the security, privacy and governance rules were followed — that surfaces *later*, in a security review or a data-protection audit, when a CISO/CIO finds non-compliant software months in. INTENTRON puts the rules up front in a machine-executable contract and catches violations *at commit time* (`sensitive-paths` → `review-ok`, `personal-data` → `privacy-ok`, Layer-0 bodyguard) — not in the audit; spec-linkage + `audit-trace.sh` hand the evidence to the auditor proactively (see `docs/runbooks/audit-perspective.md`). The team keeps its speed — inside the guardrails. For regulated work the `heavy` mode dials compliance evidence, mandatory review and branch protection up automatically.

## How INTENTRON differs

A methodical comparison against the two closest framework categories — spec-driven (Spec Kit) and harness optimizers (ECC, Everything Claude Code):

| | INTENTRON | Spec Kit (spec-driven) | ECC (harness optimizer) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Focus | Path from intent → production, with gates | Specification → code | Breadth across Claude Code tools |
| Hard gates (blocking) | ✅ Spec, Sensitive-Paths, Coverage, Slopsquatting | ❌ none | ❌ none |
| Intent before spec | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Governance scales (Solo→Enterprise) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Privacy/Security built in | ✅ (DPO + Security-Architect) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Tool-neutral (1 contract) | ✅ AGENTS.md + CONVENTIONS | partial | ❌ (Claude-Code-bound) |

**A different category, not a competitor:** ECC and similar collections are *harness optimizers / tool pools* — breadth across many tools. INTENTRON is a *method with enforced discipline* — depth. Different axes: breadth does not replace gates.

### The full picture — vs. the orchestration frameworks

A dimension-by-dimension comparison against the agent-orchestration tools (an honest read — what others do better is called out below):

| Dimension | **INTENTRON** | CrewAI | AutoGen / AG2 | BMAD | Cursor Rules |
|-----------|---------------|--------|---------------|------|--------------|
| **Governance enforcement** | ✅ Machine-enforced (Git hooks) | ❌ none | ❌ none | ⚠️ manual | ❌ none |
| **Traceability** | ✅ Idea → issue → spec → commit | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ partial | ❌ |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | ✅ Enforced (spec sign-off) | ⚠️ optional | ⚠️ optional | ✅ explicit | ❌ |
| **Self-healing** | ✅ Cron, 15 min, auto-corrects | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Learning loop** | ✅ Outcome check + LEARNINGS.md | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Model routing** | ✅ Opus/Sonnet/Haiku per task type | ⚠️ configurable | ✅ good | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Multi-agent orchestration** | ✅ Agent teams + parallel subagents | ✅ strong | ✅ very strong | ⚠️ manual | ❌ |
| **Deploy automation** | ⚠️ partial (Git push + manual) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Portability** | ✅ Zero dependencies, 1 folder | ⚠️ pip install | ⚠️ pip install | ⚠️ prompt files | ✅ |
| **Project setup time** | ~30 min (guided) | hours | hours | ~1h | minutes |
| **Target audience** | Solo dev → enterprise team | Enterprise teams | Research / quality | Agile teams | Individual devs |

**Where others are genuinely stronger** — and when to prefer them:

| Framework | Real strength | When to prefer it |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **CrewAI** | Scalable role-based crews for enterprise — used by 60% of the Fortune 500. Best choice when coordinating >10 agents. | Large team, many parallel workflows, enterprise compliance requirements |
| **AutoGen / AG2** | Debate pattern: two agents argue against each other toward the best solution. Highest output quality for complex analysis tasks. | Research, code review with the highest quality bar, offline batch processes |
| **BMAD** | Structured agile workflow with clear roles (PM, Architect, Developer). Well documented, large community. | Teams already on Scrum/Agile that want an AI-native workflow |
| **Cursor Rules** | Ready to use instantly, zero setup time, right in the editor. | Individual devs who want to start fast without governance overhead |

*(Bootstrap's [README](bootstrap/README.md#framework-vergleich) adds the onboarding view: what makes INTENTRON unique and when to choose it.)*

![INTENTRON positioning — depth & enforcement vs. breadth](docs/intentron-positioning.en.png)

*The full landscape on two axes: spec-driven, harness optimizers and orchestration frameworks all cluster on breadth/low enforcement; INTENTRON alone holds the governance zone — enforced discipline from intent to production, scaling solo → enterprise.*

## What Is This?

`intentron/` is a tool-neutral container of skills — implemented for Claude Code as the reference runtime and portable to Codex, Cursor and other AI tools (see [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) + HANDBUCH Appendix K) — that form one coherent development workflow:

- **The orchestrator** (`bootstrap/`) interviews you about a new project and scaffolds the full governance framework: runtime instructions, documentation SSoT, Developer Onboarding, backlog adapter, Git hooks, skill selection, optional learning-loop.
- **Sub-skills** (`ideation/`, `implement/`, etc.) cover the downstream delivery workflow — from idea to sprint review.
- **Specialist bundle skills** (`security-architect/`, `dpo/`) live **inside the framework repo** (vendored, since BOO-74) so a single `git clone` is self-contained. Bootstrap installs them from here.
- **Companion skills** (`../research/`, `../skill-creator/`, etc.) are referenced by the governance flow but maintained as stand-alone skills at `claudecodeskills/` top level.

Full setup guide: **[HANDBUCH.md](HANDBUCH.md)** (German, ~230 KB) + **[HANDBUCH.en.md](HANDBUCH.en.md)** (English, ~200 KB) — appendices A–Z cover Hermes, sprint sizing, Codex onboarding (J), tool adapters (K), token efficiency (N), privacy (O), deployment scenarios (P), sovereignty stack (Q), multi-operator coordination (R), skill-installation strategy (S), post-install verification (T), multi-project operation (U), Layer-0 Edit-Bodyguard (V), Contribute-Back loop (W), CONTEXT.md / Ubiquitous Language (X), the VPS/cloud team runbook (Y) and customer onboarding / the artifact & sign-off map (Z).

**What's new (latest: v0.7.7):** the full history lives in **[docs/releases/](docs/releases/)** — every version has a bilingual GitHub Release. Highlights since v0.6: enterprise readiness & **EU AI Act** opt-in (v0.7.0–v0.7.2), end-to-end compliance mechanism + sketch (v0.7.3–v0.7.4), the customer-onboarding **[artifact & sign-off map](docs/onboarding/artefakt-landkarte.md)** that links every artifact to its sign-off role and rule sink (v0.7.5), and full DE/EN documentation parity — every skill README and every sketch in both languages (v0.7.6–v0.7.7). Earlier waves (v0.2–v0.5): privacy-by-design, deployment scenarios, sovereignty stack, multi-operator coordination, Layer-0 Edit-Bodyguard, dpo control catalogue, CONTEXT.md ubiquitous language.

**Tool-neutral specification:** [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) — describes the framework conventions without binding to a specific AI tool. Read this first when adopting the framework with Codex, Cursor, or any other tool (see HANDBUCH Appendix K).

**Project handover by design:** every bootstrap now chooses a project documentation SSoT: Obsidian Vault, repo `docs/project/`, external DMS, or an explicit repo fallback. It also creates or links a `Developer Onboarding` artifact so an unfamiliar team or another coding tool can take over the project without relying on old chat history.

---

## Quickstart

Three ways to get INTENTRON into your AI coding tool. The framework repo is **public** and `bootstrap/` sits at the repo root — so the bootstrap skill is a single `git clone` away. The `/bootstrap` skill then sets up your project and pulls every other skill it needs.

> **⚠ Rolling this out at a customer?** Before `/bootstrap`, have the three onboarding checklists ready — start with **[`bootstrap-prep.md`](docs/onboarding/bootstrap-prep.md)**: the questions that make the setup run cleanly. Full guide: **[Onboarding a customer](#onboarding-a-customer--the-three-checklists)** below.

### A) Manual install, then `/bootstrap`

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cd /tmp
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/vibercoder79/intentron.git intentron
cd intentron && git sparse-checkout set bootstrap
cp -r bootstrap ~/.claude/skills/
cd /tmp && rm -rf intentron
ls ~/.claude/skills/bootstrap/   # should show SKILL.md + references/
```

Then open Claude Code in your project folder and run `/bootstrap`. (Restart the session once so the freshly copied skill is registered as a slash command.) Full step-by-step: **[HANDBUCH §4](HANDBUCH.md)**.

### B) AI self-install (let the tool do it)

Claude Code has shell access, so it can install itself. Paste this into a session opened in an empty project folder:

> Clone the public repo https://github.com/vibercoder79/intentron, copy its `bootstrap/` folder into `~/.claude/skills/bootstrap/` (create the directory if needed), confirm `~/.claude/skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` exists, then read that SKILL.md and follow it to bootstrap this project.

(Having the AI read `SKILL.md` directly means you don't have to restart the session to register the `/bootstrap` command first.)

### C) AI self-update for an old / brownfield install

For an existing repo that still runs an older INTENTRON version, the safe upgrade follows **[`bootstrap/references/framework-upgrade.md`](bootstrap/references/framework-upgrade.md)** (see also **[HANDBUCH](HANDBUCH.md)** §"Upgrade path for existing projects") — it never overwrites local decisions blindly, in three stages:

1. **`inspect`** — read the current project state, diff it against the new version, show risks and manual TODOs. Writes nothing.
2. **`apply-safe`** — apply only additive/idempotent changes (new templates, missing sections); existing content stays.
3. **`apply-with-confirmation`** — anything that changes existing rules, hooks, CI or skill versions is confirmed per change. `.env`/secrets are never touched.

One-shot prompt — paste into Claude Code opened in the old repo:

> This repo may run an older INTENTRON version. Upgrade it safely following `bootstrap/references/framework-upgrade.md` (modes inspect → apply-safe → apply-with-confirmation). (1) **inspect**: read the current project contract (`CONVENTIONS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, `.claude/environment.json`, hooks, specs), fetch the current framework from https://github.com/vibercoder79/intentron, read `docs/releases/` for what changed, and show me a diff + risks + manual TODOs without writing anything. (2) **apply-safe**: apply only additive/idempotent changes and run the relevant `bootstrap/scripts/migrate-to-v2.sh --issue BOO-NN` migrations. (3) **apply-with-confirmation**: for anything that changes existing rules, hooks, CI or skill versions, ask me per change. Never touch `.env`/secrets. Finally run `bootstrap/references/verify-setup.sh` and write an upgrade report to `journal/reports/framework-upgrade/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

> [!note]
> Same outcome, different entry point: **A** is the explicit/auditable path, **B** is the fastest cold start, **C** lifts an existing install to the current version. The migrations and `verify-setup.sh` are idempotent — safe to re-run.

## Why the method comes from "Code Crash" (and how to read this)

The thinking behind INTENTRON comes from **Matthias Schrader's book "Code Crash"**. Schrader's thesis, in one line: AI now writes the code, so the scarce resource is no longer typing speed — it is **intent, governance and the ability to still understand a system months later**. INTENTRON is our attempt to turn that thesis into a working *operating system* for AI-assisted development: skills, gates and artifacts that keep the "why" alive while the AI handles the "how".

- **You do not need to have read the book.** The framework and HANDBUCH are written to stand on their own — every concept is explained where it is used.
- **But we recommend it** for the deeper context. The HANDBUCH references Schrader throughout (anti-patterns, production-readiness, the 4P pipeline), and **Appendix M ("Schrader Decoder")** maps the book's chapters onto the concrete framework pieces.
- If you only read one thing first: this README, then [HANDBUCH.en.md](HANDBUCH.en.md) §1–§8.

## Not a one-size-fits-all framework

INTENTRON gives you a **solid base structure** — but every company, team and setup is different, and we deliberately **do not try to model every case** in the framework itself. The framework stays lightweight; the **HANDBUCH appendices provide guidance for different circumstances** so you can adapt it to your reality:

| Your situation | Where the guidance is |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Solo vs. VPS vs. team-server | Appendix P (deployment scenarios) |
| Team of 5–20+ developers | Appendix R (multi-operator coordination) |
| Where do skills/tools/hooks live | Appendix S (installation strategy) |
| Several projects on one machine | Appendix U (multi-project operation) |
| EU / regulated industry | Appendix Q (sovereignty stack) + Appendix O (privacy) |
| "Did my setup actually work?" | Appendix T (post-install verification) |
| Running under Codex / another AI tool | Appendix J (Codex onboarding) + Appendix K (tool adapters) |

The framework is the skeleton. **You tailor the muscles** — the appendices tell you how, and a real consumer fork (e.g. a GitHub-Issues + personal-vault setup) shows it works in practice.

## System Overview

![Bootstrap Skill — Interview-Block flow (A–D) + setup phases (0, 4, 5, 7)](bootstrap/docs/bootstrap-big-picture.en.png)

*From empty folder to governance-ready project — four interview blocks (A–D) frame the decisions, four setup phases (0, 4, 5, 7) execute them. Block D spins up optional components only on demand.*

---

## The Skills

### Orchestrator + Sub-Skills (this folder)

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **[bootstrap](bootstrap/)** | `/bootstrap` | **Start here.** Interview-driven project setup — CLAUDE.md, Linear, Git hooks, skill selection. |
| **[intent](intent/)** | `/intent` | Captures the *why* before the spec — Perceive questions + 8-pattern anti-pattern self-check. Runs before `/ideation`. |
| **[ideation](ideation/)** | `/ideation` | Idea → 4-perspective research → Linear issue with acceptance criteria. |
| **[backlog](backlog/)** | `/backlog` | Sprint planning — which story now, which later, and why. Dependency-aware. |
| **[implement](implement/)** | `/implement` | 8-step protocol: Agent pattern → Spec → Code → Governance validation → Commit. |
| **[architecture-review](architecture-review/)** | `/architecture-review` | Reviews architecture dimensions — risks, tech debt, improvement potential. |
| **[knowledge-onboarding](knowledge-onboarding/)** | `/knowledge-onboarding` | Routes existing project docs (GAP analyses, legal research, README/PLAN, design files, demo storyboards, handover, prompts) deterministically into the framework artefacts via routing rubric (SSoT, Tier 0/1/2/3) + persisted manifest with pinning. Post-bootstrap. |
| **[sprint-review](sprint-review/)** | `/sprint-review` | Quarterly audit: architecture health, tech debt, backlog hygiene, learning loop. |
| **[pitch](pitch/)** | `/pitch` | Closes the 4P pipeline — gathers evidence (metrics, architecture diff, intent fulfillment) as a Markdown cheat sheet. No slides, human runs the demo. |
| **[grafana](grafana/)** | `/grafana` | Grafana Cloud dashboards via MCP — panels, PromQL, alert rules. |
| **[cloud-system-engineer](cloud-system-engineer/)** | `/cloud-system-engineer` | VPS/Docker infrastructure: health checks, firewall, DNS, resources. |
| **[visualize](visualize/)** | `/visualize` | Generate architecture diagrams in Miro from existing documentation. |

### Specialist bundle skills (this folder, vendored — BOO-74)

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **[security-architect](security-architect/)** | `/security-architect` | STRIDE threat modeling, OWASP Top 10, ASVS 5.0 — 4 modes (Design/Review/Audit/Skill-Scan). Installed by bootstrap when the security dimension is active. |
| **[dpo](dpo/)** | `/dpo` | Data Protection Officer — privacy by design (GDPR/BDSG/nDSG). 3 modes (Assess/Review/Audit). Versioned control catalogue (GDPR + nDSG controls as Git-tracked YAML, deterministic runner, PASS/GAP/REVIEW-NEEDED report — BOO-87). Installed by the bootstrap Privacy add-on (BOO-69). |

*Master of these two stays in `claudecodeskills/` (via `publish_skill.py`); the framework repo holds a vendored mirror so a single clone is self-contained.*

### Top-level companion skills (parent folder)

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **[research](../research/)** | `/research` | 2-tier routing: Quick (WebSearch) or Deep (Perplexity + cross-check). |
| **[skill-creator](../skill-creator/)** | `/skill-creator` | Create, package and register new skills into the global registry. |
| **[design-md-generator](../design-md-generator/)** | `/design-md-generator` | Extract a website's visual design system into a machine-readable DESIGN.md. |
| **[setup-checklist](../setup-checklist/)** | `/setup-checklist` | Claude Code best-practice audit — global and project settings. |

---

## How the Skills Work Together

```
💡 Idea
  └─ /ideation ──→ Linear issue + ACs (4 perspectives, research-backed)
       └─ /backlog ──→ Prioritization: which story goes next?
            └─ /implement ──→ Spec file → Code → Governance validation → Commit
                 └─ /architecture-review ──→ Risks? Tech debt?
                      └─ /sprint-review ──→ Quarterly audit: what worked?
                           └─ /pitch ──→ Evidence briefing for the stakeholder demo
```

Governance gates run automatically on `git commit` / `git push` (and `git pull`):
- `spec-gate.sh` — blocks commits without a linked spec file
- `doc-version-sync.sh` — blocks pushes when documentation is out of sync
- `sensitive-paths` gate (BOO-18) — stops at security-sensitive paths until `review-ok`
- `personal-data-paths` gate (BOO-69) — stops at personal-data paths until `privacy-ok`
- `post-merge` vault-harvest hook (BOO-77, opt-in) — mirrors selected docs into a personal vault after `git pull`

No spec, no commit. That's the difference between a prompt and a governance framework.

> **Operating at scale:** running on a VPS, a team, or in a regulated industry? HANDBUCH appendices **P** (deployment scenarios), **R** (multi-operator coordination, 5–20+ operators), **S** (where do skills/tools/hooks belong) and **Q** (EU-sovereignty stack) cover the setup decisions; appendix **O** documents privacy-by-design.

## Where to Start

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| New project, empty folder | → [/bootstrap](bootstrap/) — start here |
| Existing project, needs structure | → [HANDBUCH.md §4](HANDBUCH.md) — step-by-step retrofit |
| Just one specific skill | → Clone the skill folder and install it |
| Want to understand everything first | → [HANDBUCH.md](HANDBUCH.md) — full reference |
| Rolling out at a customer | → [docs/onboarding/](docs/onboarding/) — the three checklists (start here) |
| Concrete operational question | → [docs/qa.md](docs/qa.md) — living Q&A |

---

## Onboarding a customer — the three checklists

Installing INTENTRON at a customer needs information that the generic bootstrap cannot pre-ask. The [`docs/onboarding/`](docs/onboarding/) folder holds three checklists — work them in order:

| # | Checklist | Question | Audience |
|---|-----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | [`bootstrap-prep.md`](docs/onboarding/bootstrap-prep.md) | **What do you want to build, and in which environment?** Basic questions answered up front, before the ~15-min setup call. | Business / management / IT |
| 2 | [`integration-discovery.md`](docs/onboarding/integration-discovery.md) | **How does the solution integrate into your live systems?** CI/CD, interfaces, network, secrets, compliance, go-live. | Customer IT |
| 3 | [`artefakt-landkarte.md`](docs/onboarding/artefakt-landkarte.md) | **Which artifacts exist, what purpose each serves, which stakeholders you must talk to, and where the resulting rules go?** The bridge that turns customer specifications into framework rules. | Operator + all sign-off roles |

Checklists 1 and 2 gather input. Checklist 3 is the planning and sign-off layer: it maps every framework artifact to the customer-side role that reconciles it and to the rule sink where the resulting rule is stored — so an autonomous team can later develop in a compliant way on its own. Each document has an English `.en.md` sibling.

---

## Complementary tooling — machine setup

Before you `/bootstrap` a project, the **machine/instance** itself benefits from a best-practice Claude Code setup (effort level, sandboxing, permission modes, MCP, a global `CLAUDE.md`). That is **not** part of this framework — it lives in a separate, standalone tool:

**→ [claude-code-setup-checklist](https://github.com/vibercoder79/claude-code-setup-checklist)** — an interactive best-practice setup checklist for Claude Code (Opus 4.8).

The two are complementary and operate at different layers. Recommended order on a fresh cloud / Claude Code instance:

1. **`setup-checklist global`** — machine best practice (effort, sandbox, permission modes, MCP, global `CLAUDE.md`).
2. **`/bootstrap`** (this framework) — project governance. Bootstrap **owns** the project `CLAUDE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, governance hooks, and `.claude/environment.json`.
3. **Optional `setup-checklist audit`** (or `projekt` additively) for what bootstrap does not provide — `.claudeignore`, `.gitignore` hygiene, `CLAUDE.local.md`. Do **not** re-create the project `CLAUDE.md` or the guard hook there; bootstrap owns those (its Layer-0 bodyguard is active).

**Rule of thumb:** machine + hygiene → the checklist · project governance files → `/bootstrap`. No file is owned twice.

---

## Prerequisites

- **An AI coding tool** — Claude Code (CLI/IDE, reference implementation) or Codex, Cursor & co. (see HANDBUCH Appendix K)
- **Backlog system** — Linear (recommended) / Microsoft 365 Planner / GitHub Issues / none
- **GitHub** repository for your project
- **Project documentation SSoT** — Obsidian Vault, repo `docs/project/`, external DMS, or temporary repo fallback
- Optional extensions: Grafana Cloud, Miro, Hostinger VPS — skills use what's available

# INTENTRON — Governance für KI-gestützte Entwicklung
### by OWLIST

> **Lizenz:** Source-available (PolyForm Perimeter 1.0.0) — nutzbar und anpassbar für eigene Projekte, **kein Weiterverkauf**. ([Details](#lizenz))

> Ein **battle-tested, tool-neutrales Governance-Framework** für KI-gestützte Entwicklung — Referenz-Implementierung in Claude Code, läuft genauso mit Codex, Cursor und anderen KI-Tools. Ein interview-geführter Orchestrator plus kohärente Sub-Skills setzen ein vollständiges KI-getriebenes Governance-Framework für jedes neue Projekt auf und decken den kompletten Delivery-Zyklus ab.

**Kernidee:** KI schreibt deinen Code. Governance stellt sicher, dass du in 6 Monaten noch weißt warum.

INTENTRON setzt die im Buch »Code Crash« von Matthias Schrader beschriebene Methode in ein funktionierendes Betriebssystem für KI-gestützte Entwicklung um.

**Der Name — INTENT + -TRON:** *Intent* ist Schraders Kernbegriff — wir erweitern Spec-Driven Development um die Ebene *über* der Spec: Jede Story ist auf einen **Intent** ausgerichtet (das *Warum*), nicht nur auf eine Spezifikation (das *Was*). Die Endung *-tron* benennt eine **Maschine** (Zyklotron, Magnetron). Zusammen ist INTENTRON **die Engine, die Intent in Produktion überführt** — erzwungen und nachvollziehbar.

---

## Warum INTENTRON? Der Vorteil

Die meisten Spec-Driven-Frameworks (Spec Kit & Co.) optimieren genau eine Sache: aus einer Spezifikation Code generieren. Qualität, Governance, Sicherheit, Datenschutz, Teamfähigkeit blenden sie aus. INTENTRON dreht den Fokus: Nicht der generierte Code ist das Produkt, sondern der *Weg von der Absicht zur Produktion* — mit Leitplanken, die ein Team sonst selbst bauen müsste.

Vier Dinge unterscheiden uns konkret:

1. **Ein Vertrag — tool-neutral und maschinen-ausführbar.** Eure Regeln (Tests, Logging, Security-Schwellen, Governance) leben an *einer* Stelle und werden von drei Lesern geteilt: dem Menschen, dem KI-Tool (Claude, Codex, Cursor) und der CI, die sie erzwingt. Andere haben Regeln als Prosa, die niemand durchsetzt — und binden dich an *ein* Tool.
2. **Intent vor Implementation.** Wir starten eine Stufe früher als die Spec — beim *Warum* (nach Schrader). Das verhindert, dass die KI sauber das Falsche baut.
3. **Governance, die mitwächst.** Solo bekommt drei Gates, ein Konzern zwölf — dieselbe Platte, nur die Strenge wird gedimmt.
4. **Privacy & Security im Bündel.** DPO- und Security-Architect-Prüfungen sind eingebaut, kein Nachgedanke. Für regulierte Branchen ist das die Eintrittskarte.

**Gemeinsamer Nenner:** Andere optimieren „die KI schreibt Code". Wir optimieren „ein Team — Mensch plus *beliebige* KI — bringt Intent nach Produktion, mit Leitplanken, die es nicht selbst bauen musste." Die Leitplanken sind unsichtbar, bis sie etwas fangen — und wenn sie fangen, erklären sie warum.

**Schneller *und* compliant — gegenüber reinem Vibe Engineering.** Vibe Engineering liefert schnell Code, aber niemand garantiert, dass Security-, Datenschutz- und Governance-Regeln eingehalten wurden — das fällt *nachgelagert* auf: im Security-Review oder Datenschutz-Audit, wenn ein CISO/CIO Monate später non-compliant Software findet. INTENTRON legt die Regeln vorab in einen maschinen-ausführbaren Vertrag und fängt Verstöße *im Commit* (`sensitive-paths` → `review-ok`, `personal-data` → `privacy-ok`, Layer-0-Bodyguard) — nicht erst im Audit; Spec-Linkage + `audit-trace.sh` liefern dem Auditor den Nachweis proaktiv (siehe `docs/runbooks/audit-perspective.md`). Das Team behält sein Tempo — innerhalb der Leitplanken. Bei regulierter Arbeit zieht der `heavy`-Modus Compliance-Evidenz, Mandatory Review und Branch-Protection automatisch hoch.

## Wie sich INTENTRON unterscheidet

Ein methodischer Vergleich mit den zwei nächstliegenden Framework-Kategorien — Spec-Driven (Spec Kit) und Harness-Optimierer (ECC, Everything Claude Code):

| | INTENTRON | Spec Kit (Spec-Driven) | ECC (Harness-Optimierer) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fokus | Weg von Intent → Produktion, mit Gates | Spezifikation → Code | Breite über Claude-Code-Tools |
| Hard Gates (blockierend) | ✅ Spec, Sensitive-Paths, Coverage, Slopsquatting | ❌ keine | ❌ keine |
| Intent vor Spec | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Governance skaliert (Solo→Konzern) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Privacy/Security eingebaut | ✅ (DPO + Security-Architect) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Tool-neutral (1 Vertrag) | ✅ AGENTS.md + CONVENTIONS | teilweise | ❌ (Claude-Code-gebunden) |

**Eine andere Kategorie, kein Wettbewerber:** ECC und ähnliche Sammlungen sind *Harness-Optimierer / Werkzeug-Pools* (Breite über viele Tools). INTENTRON ist eine *Methode mit erzwungener Disziplin* (Tiefe). Verschiedene Achsen — Breite ersetzt keine Gates.

### Das volle Bild — vs. die Orchestrierungs-Frameworks

Ein Dimension-für-Dimension-Vergleich gegen die Agent-Orchestrierungs-Tools (ehrlich gelesen — was andere besser machen, steht direkt darunter):

| Dimension | **INTENTRON** | CrewAI | AutoGen / AG2 | BMAD | Cursor Rules |
|-----------|---------------|--------|---------------|------|--------------|
| **Governance-Enforcement** | ✅ Maschinell erzwungen (Git Hooks) | ❌ Keine | ❌ Keine | ⚠️ Manuell | ❌ Keine |
| **Traceability** | ✅ Idee → Issue → Spec → Commit | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ Partiell | ❌ |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | ✅ Erzwungen (Spec-Freigabe) | ⚠️ Optional | ⚠️ Optional | ✅ Explizit | ❌ |
| **Self-Healing** | ✅ Cron, 15 Min, auto-korrigiert | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Learning-Loop** | ✅ Outcome-Check + LEARNINGS.md | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Modell-Routing** | ✅ Opus/Sonnet/Haiku je Task-Typ | ⚠️ Konfigurierbar | ✅ Gut | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Multi-Agent Orchestrierung** | ✅ Agent-Teams + Parallel-Subagents | ✅ Stark | ✅ Sehr stark | ⚠️ Manuell | ❌ |
| **Deploy-Automation** | ⚠️ Teilweise (Git Push + Manual) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Portabilität** | ✅ Zero Dependencies, 1 Ordner | ⚠️ pip install | ⚠️ pip install | ⚠️ Prompt-Files | ✅ |
| **Projekt-Setup-Zeit** | ~30 Min (geführt) | Stunden | Stunden | ~1h | Minuten |
| **Zielgruppe** | Solo-Dev → Enterprise-Team | Enterprise-Teams | Forschung / Quality | Agile Teams | Einzelentwickler |

**Was andere Frameworks besser machen** — und wann du sie bevorzugen solltest:

| Framework | Echte Stärke | Wann bevorzugen |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **CrewAI** | Skalierbare Role-based Crews für Enterprise — 60% der Fortune 500 nutzen es. Beste Wahl wenn >10 Agents koordiniert werden müssen. | Großes Team, viele parallele Workflows, Enterprise-Compliance-Anforderungen |
| **AutoGen / AG2** | Debate-Pattern: 2 Agents argumentieren gegeneinander bis zur besten Lösung. Höchste Ausgabequalität für komplexe Analyse-Aufgaben. | Forschung, Code-Review mit höchsten Qualitätsanforderungen, offline Batch-Prozesse |
| **BMAD** | Strukturierter Agile-Workflow mit klaren Rollen (PM, Architect, Developer). Gut dokumentiert, große Community. | Teams die Scrum/Agile bereits kennen und einen AI-nativen Workflow wollen |
| **Cursor Rules** | Sofort einsatzbereit, keine Setup-Zeit, direkt im Editor. | Einzelentwickler die schnell starten wollen ohne Governance-Overhead |

*(Die bootstrap-[README](bootstrap/README.md#framework-vergleich) ergänzt die Onboarding-Sicht: was INTENTRON einzigartig macht und wann du es wählen solltest.)*

![INTENTRON Positionierung — Tiefe & Erzwingung vs. Breite](docs/intentron-positioning.png)

*Die volle Landschaft auf zwei Achsen: Spec-Driven, Harness-Optimierer und Orchestrierungs-Frameworks clustern alle bei Breite/wenig Erzwingung; nur INTENTRON hält die Governance-Zone — erzwungene Disziplin von Intent bis Produktion, skaliert Solo → Enterprise.*

## Was ist das hier?

`intentron/` ist ein tool-neutraler Container von Skills — implementiert für Claude Code als Referenz-Runtime und portierbar auf Codex, Cursor und andere KI-Tools (siehe [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) + HANDBUCH Anhang K) — die zusammen einen kohärenten Entwicklungs-Workflow bilden:

- **Der Orchestrator** (`bootstrap/`) führt das Interview zu einem neuen Projekt und legt das komplette Governance-Framework an: Runtime-Anweisungen, Dokumentations-SSoT, Developer Onboarding, Backlog-Adapter, Git-Hooks, Skill-Auswahl, optionaler Learning-Loop.
- **Sub-Skills** (`ideation/`, `implement/`, etc.) decken den nachgelagerten Delivery-Workflow ab — von der Idee bis zum Sprint-Review.
- **Spezialisten-Bundle-Skills** (`security-architect/`, `dpo/`) liegen **im Framework-Repo selbst** (vendored, seit BOO-74) — ein einziges `git clone` ist self-contained. Bootstrap installiert sie von hier.
- **Companion-Skills** (`../research/`, `../skill-creator/`, etc.) werden vom Governance-Flow referenziert, aber als eigenständige Skills auf Top-Level von `claudecodeskills/` gepflegt.

Komplettes Setup-Handbuch: **[HANDBUCH.md](HANDBUCH.md)** (Deutsch, ~230 KB) + **[HANDBUCH.en.md](HANDBUCH.en.md)** (Englisch, ~200 KB) — Anhaenge A–Z decken Hermes, Sprint-Sizing, Codex-Onboarding (J), Tool-Adapter (K), Token-Effizienz (N), Privacy (O), Deployment-Szenarien (P), Souveraenitaets-Stack (Q), Multi-Operator-Koordination (R), Skill-Installations-Strategie (S), Post-Install-Verifikation (T), Multi-Projekt-Betrieb (U), Layer-0-Edit-Bodyguard (V), Contribute-Back-Schleife (W), CONTEXT.md / Ubiquitous Language (X), das VPS/Cloud-Team-Runbook (Y) und Kunden-Onboarding / die Artefakt- & Freigabe-Landkarte (Z) ab.

**Was ist neu (aktuell: v0.7.7):** die komplette Historie liegt in **[docs/releases/](docs/releases/)** — jede Version hat ein zweisprachiges GitHub Release. Highlights seit v0.6: Enterprise-Readiness & **EU-AI-Act**-Opt-in (v0.7.0–v0.7.2), durchgaengige Compliance-Mechanik + Sketch (v0.7.3–v0.7.4), die Kunden-Onboarding-**[Artefakt- & Freigabe-Landkarte](docs/onboarding/artefakt-landkarte.md)**, die jedes Artefakt mit Abnehmer-Rolle und Regel-Senke verknuepft (v0.7.5), und volle DE/EN-Doku-Paritaet — jedes Skill-README und jeder Sketch in beiden Sprachen (v0.7.6–v0.7.7). Fruehere Wellen (v0.2–v0.5): Privacy-by-Design, Deployment-Szenarien, Souveraenitaets-Stack, Multi-Operator-Koordination, Layer-0-Edit-Bodyguard, dpo-Kontrollkatalog, CONTEXT.md Ubiquitous Language.

**Tool-neutrale Spezifikation:** [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) — beschreibt die Framework-Konventionen ohne Bindung an ein bestimmtes KI-Tool. Lies das zuerst, wenn du das Framework mit Codex, Cursor oder einem anderen Tool aufnimmst (siehe HANDBUCH Anhang K).

**Uebergabe standardmaessig mitgedacht:** Jeder Bootstrap waehlt jetzt eine Projekt-Dokumentations-SSoT: Obsidian Vault, Repo `docs/project/`, externes DMS oder expliziter Repo-Fallback. Zusaetzlich wird ein `Developer Onboarding` erzeugt oder verlinkt, damit ein fremdes Team oder ein anderes Coding-Tool das Projekt ohne alte Chat-Historie uebernehmen kann.

---

## Schnellstart

Drei Wege, INTENTRON in dein KI-Coding-Tool zu bekommen. Das Framework-Repo ist **public** und `bootstrap/` liegt im Repo-Root — der Bootstrap-Skill ist also ein einziges `git clone` entfernt. Der `/bootstrap`-Skill richtet danach dein Projekt ein und holt alle weiteren Skills, die er braucht.

> **⚠ Beim Kunden ausrollen?** Bevor du `/bootstrap` startest, halte die drei Onboarding-Checklisten bereit — beginne mit **[`bootstrap-prep.md`](docs/onboarding/bootstrap-prep.md)**: die Fragen, damit das Setup sauber durchlaeuft. Vollstaendig: Abschnitt **[Kunden-Onboarding](#kunden-onboarding--die-drei-checklisten)** weiter unten.

### A) Manuell installieren, dann `/bootstrap`

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cd /tmp
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/vibercoder79/intentron.git intentron
cd intentron && git sparse-checkout set bootstrap
cp -r bootstrap ~/.claude/skills/
cd /tmp && rm -rf intentron
ls ~/.claude/skills/bootstrap/   # sollte SKILL.md + references/ zeigen
```

Dann Claude Code im Projektordner starten und `/bootstrap` ausführen. (Session einmal neu starten, damit der frisch kopierte Skill als Slash-Command erkannt wird.) Schritt für Schritt: **[HANDBUCH §4](HANDBUCH.md)**.

### B) AI-Self-Install (die KI macht es selbst)

Claude Code hat Shell-Zugriff und kann sich selbst installieren. Diesen Prompt in eine Session in einem leeren Projektordner einfügen:

> Klone das public Repo https://github.com/vibercoder79/intentron, kopiere dessen `bootstrap/`-Ordner nach `~/.claude/skills/bootstrap/` (Verzeichnis ggf. anlegen), prüfe dass `~/.claude/skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` existiert, lies dann diese SKILL.md und folge ihr, um dieses Projekt zu bootstrappen.

(Wenn die KI `SKILL.md` direkt liest, musst du die Session nicht erst neu starten, damit der `/bootstrap`-Command registriert wird.)

### C) AI-Self-Update für eine alte / Brownfield-Installation

Für ein bestehendes Repo mit älterer INTENTRON-Version folgt das sichere Upgrade **[`bootstrap/references/framework-upgrade.md`](bootstrap/references/framework-upgrade.md)** (siehe auch **[HANDBUCH](HANDBUCH.md)** §„Upgrade-Pfad für bestehende Projekte") — es überschreibt lokale Entscheidungen nie blind, in drei Stufen:

1. **`inspect`** — Ist-Zustand lesen, Diff zur neuen Version, Risiken und manuelle TODOs zeigen. Schreibt nichts.
2. **`apply-safe`** — nur additive/idempotente Änderungen (neue Templates, fehlende Sektionen); Bestehendes bleibt.
3. **`apply-with-confirmation`** — alles, was bestehende Regeln, Hooks, CI oder Skill-Versionen ändert, wird einzeln bestätigt. `.env`/Secrets werden nie angefasst.

Einmal-Prompt — in Claude Code einfügen, geöffnet im alten Repo:

> Dieses Repo fährt evtl. eine ältere INTENTRON-Version. Aktualisiere es sicher nach `bootstrap/references/framework-upgrade.md` (Modi inspect → apply-safe → apply-with-confirmation). (1) **inspect**: lies den Projektvertrag (`CONVENTIONS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, `.claude/environment.json`, Hooks, Specs), hole das aktuelle Framework von https://github.com/vibercoder79/intentron, lies `docs/releases/` für die Änderungen, und zeig mir Diff + Risiken + manuelle TODOs, ohne etwas zu schreiben. (2) **apply-safe**: wende nur additive/idempotente Änderungen an und führe die zutreffenden `bootstrap/scripts/migrate-to-v2.sh --issue BOO-NN` Migrationen aus. (3) **apply-with-confirmation**: alles, was bestehende Regeln, Hooks, CI oder Skill-Versionen ändert, einzeln mit mir bestätigen. `.env`/Secrets nie anfassen. Zum Schluss `bootstrap/references/verify-setup.sh` ausführen und einen Upgrade-Report nach `journal/reports/framework-upgrade/YYYY-MM-DD.md` schreiben.

> [!note]
> Gleiches Ergebnis, anderer Einstieg: **A** ist der explizite/auditierbare Weg, **B** der schnellste Kaltstart, **C** hebt eine bestehende Installation auf den aktuellen Stand. Migrationen und `verify-setup.sh` sind idempotent — gefahrlos wiederholbar.

## Warum die Methode aus »Code Crash« kommt (und wie man das hier liest)

Der Denkanstoss hinter INTENTRON kommt aus **Matthias Schraders Buch »Code Crash«**. Schraders These in einem Satz: Die KI schreibt jetzt den Code — die knappe Ressource ist nicht mehr Tippgeschwindigkeit, sondern **Intent, Governance und die Faehigkeit, ein System auch in Monaten noch zu verstehen**. INTENTRON ist unser Versuch, diese These in ein funktionierendes *Betriebssystem* fuer KI-gestuetzte Entwicklung zu giessen: Skills, Gates und Artefakte, die das "Warum" am Leben halten, waehrend die KI das "Wie" uebernimmt.

- **Du musst das Buch nicht gelesen haben.** Framework und HANDBUCH stehen fuer sich — jedes Konzept wird dort erklaert, wo es genutzt wird.
- **Wir empfehlen es aber** fuer den tieferen Kontext. Das HANDBUCH nimmt durchgehend Bezug auf Schrader (Anti-Patterns, Production-Readiness, 4P-Pipeline), und **Anhang M ("Schrader-Decoder")** mappt die Buch-Kapitel auf die konkreten Framework-Bausteine.
- Wenn du zuerst nur eines liest: diese README, dann [HANDBUCH.md](HANDBUCH.md) §1–§8.

## Kein One-Size-Fits-All-Framework

INTENTRON gibt dir eine **solide Grundstruktur** — aber jedes Unternehmen, Team und Setup ist anders, und wir versuchen bewusst **nicht, jeden Einzelfall** im Framework selbst abzubilden. Das Framework bleibt leichtgewichtig; die **HANDBUCH-Anhaenge geben Guidance fuer unterschiedliche Gegebenheiten**, damit du es an deine Realitaet anpasst:

| Deine Situation | Wo die Guidance steht |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Solo vs. VPS vs. Team-Server | Anhang P (Deployment-Szenarien) |
| Team mit 5–20+ Entwicklern | Anhang R (Multi-Operator-Koordination) |
| Wo gehoeren Skills/Tools/Hooks hin | Anhang S (Installations-Strategie) |
| Mehrere Projekte auf einer Maschine | Anhang U (Multi-Projekt-Betrieb) |
| EU / regulierte Branche | Anhang Q (Souveraenitaets-Stack) + Anhang O (Privacy) |
| "Hat mein Setup wirklich funktioniert?" | Anhang T (Post-Install-Verifikation) |
| Betrieb unter Codex / anderem KI-Tool | Anhang J (Codex-Onboarding) + Anhang K (Tool-Adapter) |

Das Framework ist das Skelett. **Die Muskeln schneiderst du** — die Anhaenge zeigen wie, und ein echter Consumer-Fork (z.B. ein GitHub-Issues- + persoenlicher-Vault-Setup) zeigt, dass es in der Praxis traegt.

## Das System im Überblick

![Bootstrap Skill — Interview-Block-Flow (A–D) + Setup-Phasen (0, 4, 5, 7)](bootstrap/docs/bootstrap-big-picture.png)

*Vom leeren Ordner zum governance-ready Projekt — vier Interview-Blöcke (A–D) umrahmen die Entscheidungen, vier Setup-Phasen (0, 4, 5, 7) setzen sie um. Block D aktiviert optionale Komponenten nur auf Wunsch.*

---

## Die Skills

### Orchestrator + Sub-Skills (dieser Ordner)

| Skill | Befehl | Was er tut |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **[bootstrap](bootstrap/)** | `/bootstrap` | **Einstieg:** Interview-geführtes Projekt-Setup — CLAUDE.md, Linear, Git-Hooks, Skill-Auswahl. |
| **[intent](intent/)** | `/intent` | Hält das *Warum* vor der Spec fest — Perceive-Fragen + 8-Pattern-Anti-Pattern-Self-Check. Läuft vor `/ideation`. |
| **[ideation](ideation/)** | `/ideation` | Idee → 4-Perspektiven-Research → Linear Issue mit ACs. |
| **[backlog](backlog/)** | `/backlog` | Sprint Planning — welche Story jetzt, welche nach hinten, warum. Abhängigkeiten-aware. |
| **[implement](implement/)** | `/implement` | 8-Schritte-Protokoll: Agent-Pattern → Spec → Code → Governance-Validation → Commit. |
| **[architecture-review](architecture-review/)** | `/architecture-review` | Prüft Architektur-Dimensionen — Risiken, Tech Debt, Verbesserungspotential. |
| **[knowledge-onboarding](knowledge-onboarding/)** | `/knowledge-onboarding` | Routet Bestands-Doku (GAP-Analysen, Legal-Recherche, README/PLAN, Design-Files, Demo-Storyboards, Handover, Prompts) deterministisch in die Framework-Artefakte via Routing-Rubrik (SSoT, Tier 0/1/2/3) + persistiertes Manifest mit Pinning. Post-Bootstrap. |
| **[sprint-review](sprint-review/)** | `/sprint-review` | Quartals-Audit: Architektur-Gesundheit, Tech Debt, Backlog-Hygiene, Learning-Loop. |
| **[pitch](pitch/)** | `/pitch` | Schliesst die 4P-Pipeline — sammelt Evidenz (Metriken, Architektur-Diff, Intent-Erfuellung) als Markdown-Spickzettel. Keine Slides, Mensch macht die Demo. |
| **[grafana](grafana/)** | `/grafana` | Grafana Cloud Dashboards via MCP — Panels, PromQL, Alert Rules. |
| **[cloud-system-engineer](cloud-system-engineer/)** | `/cloud-system-engineer` | VPS/Docker-Infrastruktur: Health-Check, Firewall, DNS, Ressourcen. |
| **[visualize](visualize/)** | `/visualize` | Architektur-Diagramme in Miro aus bestehenden Doku-Dateien generieren. |

### Spezialisten-Bundle-Skills (dieser Ordner, vendored — BOO-74)

| Skill | Befehl | Was er tut |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **[security-architect](security-architect/)** | `/security-architect` | STRIDE Threat Modeling, OWASP Top 10, ASVS 5.0 — 4 Modi (Design/Review/Audit/Skill-Scan). Wird vom Bootstrap installiert, wenn die Security-Dimension aktiv ist. |
| **[dpo](dpo/)** | `/dpo` | Data Protection Officer — Datenschutz by Design (DSGVO/BDSG/nDSG). 3 Modi (Assess/Review/Audit). Versionierter Kontrollkatalog (DSGVO + nDSG Controls als Git-versionierte YAML, deterministischer Runner, Report mit PASS/GAP/REVIEW-NEEDED — BOO-87). Wird vom Privacy-Add-on des Bootstrap installiert (BOO-69). |

*Master dieser zwei bleibt in `claudecodeskills/` (via `publish_skill.py`); das Framework-Repo haelt einen vendored Mirror, damit ein einziges Clone self-contained ist.*

### Top-Level Companion-Skills (Elternordner)

| Skill | Befehl | Was er tut |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **[research](../research/)** | `/research` | 2-Tier-Routing: Quick (WebSearch) oder Deep (Perplexity + Gegencheck). |
| **[skill-creator](../skill-creator/)** | `/skill-creator` | Neue Skills erstellen, paketieren und in die globale Registry einbinden. |
| **[design-md-generator](../design-md-generator/)** | `/design-md-generator` | Visuelles Design-System einer Website als maschinenlesbare DESIGN.md extrahieren. |
| **[setup-checklist](../setup-checklist/)** | `/setup-checklist` | Claude Code Best-Practice-Audit — globale und projekt-Settings. |

---

## Wie die Skills zusammenspielen

```
💡 Idee
  └─ /ideation ──→ Linear Issue + ACs (4 Perspektiven, Research-backed)
       └─ /backlog ──→ Priorisierung: welche Story jetzt?
            └─ /implement ──→ Spec-File → Code → Governance-Validation → Commit
                 └─ /architecture-review ──→ Risiken? Tech Debt?
                      └─ /sprint-review ──→ Quartals-Audit: Was hat funktioniert?
                           └─ /pitch ──→ Evidenz-Briefing fuer den Stakeholder-Demo
```

Governance-Gates laufen automatisch bei `git commit` / `git push` (und `git pull`):
- `spec-gate.sh` — blockiert Commits ohne verknüpftes Spec-File
- `doc-version-sync.sh` — blockiert Pushes wenn Doku veraltet ist
- `sensitive-paths`-Gate (BOO-18) — stoppt bei security-sensitiven Pfaden bis `review-ok`
- `personal-data-paths`-Gate (BOO-69) — stoppt bei personenbezogenen Pfaden bis `privacy-ok`
- `post-merge`-Vault-Harvest-Hook (BOO-77, opt-in) — spiegelt ausgewaehlte Docs nach `git pull` in einen persoenlichen Vault

Kein Spec, kein Commit. Das ist der Unterschied zwischen einem Prompt und einem Governance-Framework.

> **Im Team / auf VPS / reguliert?** HANDBUCH-Anhaenge **P** (Deployment-Szenarien), **R** (Multi-Operator-Koordination, 5–20+ Operatoren), **S** (wo gehoeren Skills/Tools/Hooks hin) und **Q** (EU-Souveraenitaets-Stack) decken die Setup-Entscheidungen ab; Anhang **O** dokumentiert Privacy-by-Design.

---

## Wo anfangen?

| Situation | Empfehlung |
|-----------|------------|
| Neues Projekt, leerer Ordner | → [/bootstrap](bootstrap/) |
| Bestehendes Projekt, Chaos | → [HANDBUCH.md §4](HANDBUCH.md) |
| Nur einzelne Skills | → Gewünschten Skill-Ordner klonen und installieren |
| Alles verstehen bevor ich anfange | → [HANDBUCH.md](HANDBUCH.md) |
| Beim Kunden ausrollen | → [docs/onboarding/](docs/onboarding/) — die drei Checklisten (hier starten) |
| Konkrete Praxisfrage | → [docs/qa.md](docs/qa.md) — lebendes Q&A |

---

## Kunden-Onboarding — die drei Checklisten

Die Installation von INTENTRON beim Kunden braucht Informationen, die der generische Bootstrap nicht vorab abfragen kann. Der Ordner [`docs/onboarding/`](docs/onboarding/) enthält drei Checklisten — der Reihe nach durcharbeiten:

| # | Checkliste | Frage | Zielgruppe |
|---|-----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | [`bootstrap-prep.md`](docs/onboarding/bootstrap-prep.md) | **Was wollt ihr bauen, und in welcher Umgebung?** Grundsätzliche Fragen, vorab beantwortet vor dem ~15-Min-Setup-Gespräch. | Fachseite / Management / IT |
| 2 | [`integration-discovery.md`](docs/onboarding/integration-discovery.md) | **Wie integriert sich die Solution in eure Live-Systeme?** CI/CD, Schnittstellen, Netzwerk, Secrets, Compliance, Go-Live. | Kunden-IT |
| 3 | [`artefakt-landkarte.md`](docs/onboarding/artefakt-landkarte.md) | **Welche Artefakte gibt es, welchen Zweck erfüllt jedes, mit welchen Stakeholdern musst du sprechen, und wo landen die resultierenden Regeln?** Die Brücke, die Kunden-Vorgaben in Framework-Regeln übersetzt. | Operator + alle Abnehmer-Rollen |

Checkliste 1 und 2 sammeln Input. Checkliste 3 ist der Planungs- und Abnahme-Layer: Sie verknüpft jedes Framework-Artefakt mit der Kundenseiten-Rolle, die es abgleicht, und mit der Regel-Senke, in der die resultierende Regel landet — damit ein autonomes Team anschließend regelkonform selbst entwickeln kann. Jedes Dokument hat eine englische `.en.md`-Schwester.

---

## Komplementäres Tooling — Maschinen-Setup

Bevor du ein Projekt mit `/bootstrap` aufsetzt, profitiert die **Maschine/Instanz** selbst von einem Best-Practice-Claude-Code-Setup (Effort-Level, Sandboxing, Permission-Modi, MCP, globale `CLAUDE.md`). Das ist **nicht** Teil dieses Frameworks — es lebt in einem eigenen, eigenständigen Tool:

**→ [claude-code-setup-checklist](https://github.com/vibercoder79/claude-code-setup-checklist)** — eine interaktive Best-Practice-Setup-Checkliste für Claude Code (Opus 4.8).

Die beiden ergänzen sich und arbeiten auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen. Empfohlene Reihenfolge bei einer frischen Cloud-/Claude-Code-Instanz:

1. **`setup-checklist global`** — Maschinen-Best-Practice (Effort, Sandbox, Permission-Modi, MCP, globale `CLAUDE.md`).
2. **`/bootstrap`** (dieses Framework) — Projekt-Governance. Bootstrap **besitzt** die Projekt-`CLAUDE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, Governance-Hooks und `.claude/environment.json`.
3. **Optional `setup-checklist audit`** (oder `projekt` additiv) für das, was bootstrap nicht liefert — `.claudeignore`, `.gitignore`-Hygiene, `CLAUDE.local.md`. Dort die Projekt-`CLAUDE.md` und den Guard-Hook **nicht** erneut anlegen; die besitzt bootstrap (Layer-0-Bodyguard ist aktiv).

**Faustregel:** Maschine + Hygiene → die Checkliste · Projekt-Governance-Dateien → `/bootstrap`. Keine Datei wird doppelt besessen.

---

## Voraussetzungen

- **Ein KI-Coding-Tool** — Claude Code (CLI/IDE, Referenz-Implementierung) oder Codex, Cursor & Co. (siehe HANDBUCH Anhang K)
- **Backlog-System** — Linear (empfohlen) / Microsoft 365 Planner / GitHub Issues / keines
- **GitHub** Repository für dein Projekt
- **Projekt-Dokumentations-SSoT** — Obsidian Vault, Repo `docs/project/`, externes DMS oder temporaerer Repo-Fallback
- Optional: Grafana Cloud, Miro, Hostinger VPS — Skills nutzen was verfügbar ist
