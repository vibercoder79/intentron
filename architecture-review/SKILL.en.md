# Architecture Review

Check the active dimensions (8 standard + active add-ons from `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md §5`) against a story or the whole system.

## Step 0: Load environment

1. Read `.claude/environment.json` (if present — otherwise fall back to defaults and log a warning).
2. Read `CONVENTIONS.md` if present. Extract `governance_mode`, `execution_isolation` and active gates. Fallback: `standard` + `write-scope`.
3. Extract paths from `paths.*` as needed (e.g. `paths.reports_local`, `paths.lessons_l3`, `paths.specs`, `paths.architecture_design`, `paths.conventions`).
4. Before any tool invocation, check `tools_available.<tool>`. If `false` or missing, the skill skips the call and notes it in the output.
5. Missing-file fallback: assume the schema defaults (`journal/`, `journal/reports/local/`, `specs/`, `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`) and add a note to the output: "Note: `.claude/environment.json` is missing — defaults active. Recommendation: re-run `/bootstrap` or create the file manually."

## Modes

### Mode A: Story review (default)

Architecturally assess a single story or planned change.

1. **Read `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` IN FULL** — to the last line — all sections §1–§6 (plus any add-on sections §7+) and all ADRs.
   **Mandatory checklist — all sections must be read:**
   - [ ] §1 Big Picture (system map, components and connections)
   - [ ] §2 Design rationale (the why behind the architectural decisions)
   - [ ] §3 ADR — Architecture Decision Records (all existing ADRs in full, ADR-01 through the last one)
   - [ ] §4 Component overview (every recorded component with paths and dependencies)
   - [ ] §5 Quality dimensions (active standard dimensions + add-ons)
     - **Reliability invariant check (mandatory, BOO-25):** When checking §1 Reliability the reviewer MUST validate the 5 invariants against the project's `docs/SLO.md`, `lib/idempotency.{js,py}`, `lib/retry.{js,py}` and `lib/circuit-breaker.{js,py}`:
       1. **Idempotency invariant** — `Idempotency-Key` header (UUID v4) on all write endpoints, request hash + response with 24h TTL in `lib/idempotency.{js,py}`, same key + diverging body -> HTTP 422
       2. **Retry+backoff invariant** — all downstream calls wrapped by `lib/retry.{js,py}`, max. 3 attempts with exponential backoff + jitter, only 5xx/timeout/connection-reset retried (no 4xx, no 422)
       3. **Circuit-breaker / bulkhead invariant** — one breaker per external dependency via `lib/circuit-breaker.{js,py}`, defaults `errorThreshold` 50% / `resetTimeout` 30s / `volumeThreshold` 10, state changes structured-logged (BOO-14)
       4. **Graceful-degradation invariant** — fallback behavior per feature path documented, kill switch / feature flag per critical path, read-only mode on write-DB failure, cached-response fallback flagged with `X-Stale: true`
       5. **SLO + error-budget invariant** — `docs/SLO.md` with availability target per service (99.9 / 99.95 / 99.99), error-budget table per quarter, 3 SLIs (latency P95, availability, error rate) with measurement method, review cadence (default monthly)
     - Detail questions per invariant: see [references/dimensions-detail.en.md](references/dimensions-detail.en.md) §1.1 / §1.2 / §1.3 / §1.4 / §1.5.
     - **Performance invariant check (mandatory, BOO-16):** When checking §4 Performance the reviewer MUST validate the 3 invariants against the project's `journal/perf-baseline.json` and `.github/workflows/perf.yml`:
       1. **Baseline-existence invariant** — `journal/perf-baseline.json` with 7 mandatory fields per service, `recorded_at` younger than 30 sprints, bench skeleton (`bench/<service>.bench.js` or `bench/<service>_bench.py`) in place
       2. **Baseline-trend invariant** — P95 growth across the last 10 commits <=10% (pass), 10–20% architectural hint, >=20% critical (gate should have blocked)
       3. **Gate invariant** — `.github/workflows/perf.yml` as required status check, 3-threshold logic (<=1.05 pass / 1.05–1.20 warning / >1.20 block), override via PR label `perf-override` or commit trailer `Perf-Override:`, override log at `journal/reports/perf/overrides.log`
     - Detail questions per invariant: see [references/dimensions-detail.en.md](references/dimensions-detail.en.md) §4.1 / §4.2 / §4.3.
     - **Observability invariant check (mandatory, BOO-14):** When checking §5 Observability the reviewer MUST validate the 3 invariants against the project's `observability.md` and `observability/alerts/`:
       1. **Logging-schema invariant** — structured JSON logging with 6 mandatory fields, logger choice recorded as ADR
       2. **Metrics-endpoint invariant** — `/metrics` in Prometheus format with 4 mandatory metrics per service, port convention 9090+N
       3. **Alert-rules invariant** — `observability/alerts/<service>.yml` with 3 mandatory alerts per service, routing active, `promtool check rules` green
     - Detail questions per invariant: see [references/dimensions-detail.en.md](references/dimensions-detail.en.md) §5.1 / §5.2 / §5.3.
   - [ ] §6 References (cross-refs to other architecture docs)
   - [ ] §7+ Optional add-on sections (e.g. failure mode analysis, scalability roadmap, testing architecture — if added project-specifically)
2. Understand story/change
3. Identify affected files + components
4. Check relevant dimensions (not always all):
   See [references/dimensions-detail.en.md](references/dimensions-detail.en.md)
   **Standard dimensions:** Reliability, Data Integrity, Security, Performance, Observability, Maintainability, Testability, Scalability.
   **Add-ons (when active):** Privacy / GDPR, Cost Efficiency, Signal Quality, Compliance.
4. Present risks and recommendations
5. If needed: suggest adjustments to the story

**Execution-isolation check:** When the story uses `sub-agents` or `agentic`, review the architecture for colliding write areas, shared state, migration order and integration point. `agentic` is architecturally allowed only with `git-worktree`; with `write-scope`, only `sub-agents` are allowed.

### Mode B: System review

Check the whole system for architectural health.

1. **Read `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` IN FULL** — to the last line — all sections §1–§6 (plus add-ons §7+) and all ADRs (same checklist as mode A).
2. Read `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` IN FULL + relevant sections of `config.js`
3. Go through all active dimensions systematically (8 standard + active add-ons from `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md §5`)
3. Identify and quantify tech debt
4. Load backlog — are there issues addressing tech debt?
5. Build report:
   - Strengths (what's working)
   - Risks (what could cause problems)
   - Recommendations (concrete actions, new issues if needed)

6. Check governance conventions: do active gates, worktree/write-scope strategy and actual architecture practice match `CONVENTIONS.md`?

## Feature-flag hygiene (BOO-17)

Find stale AI-code feature flags:

    # Find AI-marked code
    grep -rn "// AI-generated:" {PROJECT_PATH}/src {PROJECT_PATH}/lib 2>/dev/null | head -20
    # For Python
    grep -rn "# AI-generated:" {PROJECT_PATH}/src {PROJECT_PATH}/lib 2>/dev/null | head -20

For each `STORY_ID` comment found:
1. Is feature flag `flag.{STORY_ID}` still active (in `config/flags.json` or env)?
2. How long has the flag been running? (`git log --follow -p -- <file> | grep "AI-generated: {STORY_ID}" | tail -1`)
3. If >72h stable in production: create a **Tech-Debt issue to remove flag + delete `// AI-generated:` comments**.

**Alert threshold:** Flag older than 7 days without removal → Tech-Debt issue with High priority.

## SonarQube Cloud API read block (BOO-6)

**Read-only.** Skill queries SonarQube Cloud via REST API and extends the review with three findings categories:

### Precondition check

1. Does `sonar-project.properties` exist at the project root? (created by `/bootstrap` block D.5 BOO-5)
2. Is `SONAR_TOKEN` available in `.env` or as an environment variable?
3. Is `tools_available.sonarqube_cloud` in `.claude/environment.json` set to `true`?

**Fallback (if any precondition fails):**

```
[!info] SonarQube Cloud not configured — metrics unavailable.
  Setup: run bootstrap block D.5 or migrate_boo_5().
  Skip: the review continues without the SonarQube block, no hard error.
```

### API calls

Read the project key from `sonar-project.properties` (`sonar.projectKey=...`), organization from `sonar.organization=...`. Base URL: `https://sonarcloud.io/api/`.

```bash
# 1. Security hotspots (unresolved) per component
curl -s -u "${SONAR_TOKEN}:" \
  "https://sonarcloud.io/api/hotspots/search?projectKey=${PROJECT_KEY}&status=TO_REVIEW&ps=100" \
  | jq '.hotspots | group_by(.component) | map({component: .[0].component, count: length})'

# 2. Technical-debt ratio + reliability + maintainability rating
curl -s -u "${SONAR_TOKEN}:" \
  "https://sonarcloud.io/api/measures/component?component=${PROJECT_KEY}&metricKeys=sqale_debt_ratio,reliability_rating,security_rating,sqale_rating" \
  | jq '.component.measures'
```

### Output integration

Add a new "SonarQube" column to the review table, per component:

| Component | Dimensions | SonarQube |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/auth` | ... | Hotspots: 2, Debt: 4.2%, Rel: B, Sec: A |

When `Hotspots > 5` OR `sqale_debt_ratio > 5.0` OR `reliability_rating != "A"`: extend the recommendation block with "→ address SonarQube findings (sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=PROJECT_KEY)".

**Important:** the skill never writes back to SonarQube. SonarQube Cloud is the source of truth for security metrics.

## Output format

Per checked dimension:
- **Status**: OK / Warning / Critical
- **Finding**: what was found
- **Recommendation**: what should change (if needed)
