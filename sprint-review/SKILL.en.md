# Sprint Review

Periodic audit of the whole system plus learning-loop entry. The skill closes the learning loop by capturing lessons-learned at the end (level L1/L2/L3 depending on project configuration).

## Workflow (9 steps)

### Step 0: Load environment

1. Read `.claude/environment.json` (if present — otherwise fall back to defaults and log a warning).
2. Read `CONVENTIONS.md` if present. Extract `governance_mode`, `execution_isolation` and active gates. Fallback: `standard` + `write-scope`.
3. Extract paths from `paths.*` as needed (e.g. `paths.reports_local`, `paths.lessons_l1`, `paths.lessons_l2_dir`, `paths.lessons_l3`, `paths.specs`, `paths.architecture_design`, `paths.conventions`).
4. Before any tool invocation, check `tools_available.<tool>`. If `false` or missing, the skill skips the call and notes it in the output.
5. Missing-file fallback: assume the schema defaults (`journal/`, `journal/reports/local/`, `specs/`, `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`) and add a note to the output: "Note: `.claude/environment.json` is missing — defaults active. Recommendation: re-run `/bootstrap` or create the file manually."

### Step 1: System snapshot

Load in parallel:
1. Full backlog (all statuses, Linear/M365/GitHub depending on tool)
2. **Read `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` IN FULL** — to the last line — all sections and ADRs.
   **Mandatory checklist:**
   - [ ] §1 Architectural Vision + guiding principles
   - [ ] §3 Quality Attributes (active standard dimensions + add-ons)
   - [ ] §4 Component references
   - [ ] §6 Phase mapping
   - [ ] §7 ADR table in full
   - [ ] §9 References (know all linked docs)
3. Read `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` in full
4. `lib/config.js` (current configuration, DOC_FILES list)
5. Git log of the last period (commits, branches, new files)
6. If self-healing active: check self-healing logs (most frequent warnings)
7. If learning loop active: read previous `journal/` entries (context for step 8)

### Step 1b: Governance-convention drift

Check whether project practice matches `CONVENTIONS.md`:

| Convention | Review question |
|---|---|
| `governance_mode: lite` | Are only baseline gates active, without heavy reports being forced? |
| `governance_mode: standard` | Are spec gate, baseline security check, tests/lint and sprint-review traces present? |
| `governance_mode: heavy` | Are extended security/compliance/architecture gates, reports and review evidence present? |
| `execution_isolation: write-scope` | Did parallel stories/sub-agents use clear `write_scopes`? |
| `execution_isolation: git-worktree` | Did parallel agents/agentic runs execute in separate worktrees or branches? |

Document deviations in the sprint report as `Governance Drift` and propose a backlog issue when the pattern repeats.

### Step 2: Architecture review (active dimensions)

Read the **active dimensions** from `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md §3 Quality Attributes`. These are the 7 standard dimensions + all add-ons activated in bootstrap block A.4.

Per active dimension: status (OK / warning / critical) + finding + recommendation.

**Standard dimensions:** Reliability, Data Integrity, Security, Performance, Observability, Maintainability, Testability

**Add-ons (if active):** Privacy / Cost Efficiency / Signal Quality / Compliance

**Testability-specific metrics in sprint review:**
- Coverage on new code (change value, BOO-15 hook): trend across the sprint?
- Test-suite pass rate: stable green or flaky / red?
- Number of newly added contract tests on external interfaces?

Detail questions per dimension: see `architecture-review/references/dimensions-detail.en.md`.

### Step 2b: Reports aggregation + metrics (BOO-6)

Sprint Review aggregates four sources per sprint and writes the results as frontmatter into the sprint file.

**Read sources (all optional, graceful skip on missing source):**

| Source | Path | What gets read |
|---|---|---|
| Local implement reports | `journal/reports/local/{date}_{story}/` | iteration counts per tool from `meta.json`, iter-N SARIF files for pattern detection |
| CI reports | `journal/reports/ci/run-{id}/` | CI success rates, common failures (BOO-32 convention) |
| SonarQube Cloud API | `https://sonarcloud.io/api/` | new hotspots in the sprint, coverage trend, cognitive-complexity trend |
| L3 DB | `journal/learnings.db` | cross-sprint trends (only when level L3 active, otherwise skip) |

**SonarQube API read block (analogous to architecture-review BOO-6):**

```bash
# Precondition check (see architecture-review SKILL.en.md BOO-6 block)
# When SONAR_TOKEN + sonar-project.properties + tools_available.sonarqube_cloud == true:

# New findings in the current sprint window (SPRINT_START_ISO -> today)
curl -s -u "${SONAR_TOKEN}:" \
  "https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/search?componentKeys=${PROJECT_KEY}&createdAfter=${SPRINT_START_ISO}&ps=100" \
  | jq '.issues | length'

# Coverage and complexity trend (history API)
curl -s -u "${SONAR_TOKEN}:" \
  "https://sonarcloud.io/api/measures/search_history?component=${PROJECT_KEY}&metrics=coverage,cognitive_complexity&from=${SPRINT_START_ISO}" \
  | jq '.measures'
```

On missing precondition: graceful skip with `[!info] SonarQube block skipped — metrics unavailable`.

**Local reports aggregation:**

```bash
# Read all meta.json files from the last N days (N = sprint length)
find journal/reports/local -name "meta.json" -mtime -${SPRINT_DAYS} | while read m; do
  jq '. | {story_id, iterations, final_status, pre_flight_warning}' "$m"
done | jq -s '
  {
    eslint_iterations_avg: (map(.iterations.eslint) | add / length),
    semgrep_findings_total: (map(.iterations.semgrep) | add),
    pre_flight_warnings_count: (map(select(.pre_flight_warning != null)) | length)
  }
'
```

**Cost aggregation (BOO-84):**

Read `token_tracking` from all sprint meta.json files and compute cost aggregates via `bootstrap/references/model-tiers.json` (pricing is central, not duplicated per meta.json).

```bash
TIERS_FILE="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/../code-crash-framework/bootstrap/references/model-tiers.json"
# Fallback: search at typical framework paths (operator setup)
if [ ! -f "$TIERS_FILE" ]; then
  TIERS_FILE=$(find ~/Documents/GitHub/code-crash-framework -name model-tiers.json -maxdepth 4 2>/dev/null | head -1)
fi

if [ -n "$TIERS_FILE" ] && [ -f "$TIERS_FILE" ]; then
  # Cost per story comes from token_tracking.story_totals.estimated_cost_usd (already populated by implement skill when hook active)
  find journal/reports/local -name "meta.json" -mtime -${SPRINT_DAYS} | while read m; do
    jq -r '
      if .token_tracking and .token_tracking.story_totals
      then
        {
          story_id: .story_id,
          model_breakdown: (
            (.token_tracking.skill_invocations // [])
            | group_by(.model_tier_default)
            | map({tier: .[0].model_tier_default, input: (map(.input_tokens_total) | add), output: (map(.output_tokens_total) | add)})
          ),
          cache_hit_rate: .token_tracking.cache_hit_rate,
          estimated_cost_usd: .token_tracking.story_totals.estimated_cost_usd,
          override_count: (.override_audit // [] | length)
        }
      else
        {story_id: .story_id, model_breakdown: null, cache_hit_rate: null, estimated_cost_usd: null, override_count: 0}
      end
    ' "$m"
  done | jq -s '
    {
      total_cost_usd: (map(.estimated_cost_usd // 0) | add),
      stories_with_token_data: (map(select(.estimated_cost_usd != null)) | length),
      stories_without_token_data: (map(select(.estimated_cost_usd == null)) | length),
      cache_hit_rate_avg: (map(.cache_hit_rate) | map(select(. != null)) | if length > 0 then add / length else null end),
      override_count_total: (map(.override_count) | add),
      tier_breakdown: (
        map(.model_breakdown // []) | flatten
        | group_by(.tier)
        | map({tier: .[0].tier, input_tokens: (map(.input) | add), output_tokens: (map(.output) | add)})
      )
    }
  '
fi
```

If `model-tiers.json` is not found or no story contains token data: graceful skip with `[!info] Cost aggregate skipped — model-tiers.json missing or token-tracking hook not active`.

**CI reports aggregation:**

```bash
# Read SARIF + JUnit XML files from journal/reports/ci/run-*/
# CI failure patterns from the last sprint:
find journal/reports/ci -name "*.sarif" -mtime -${SPRINT_DAYS} | xargs jq -s '
  [.[] | .runs[].results[] | .ruleId] | group_by(.) | map({rule: .[0], count: length}) | sort_by(-.count) | .[0:5]
'
```

**L3 DB read (when active):**

```sql
-- Trend across last 5 sprints
SELECT sprint_number, eslint_iterations_avg, coverage_trend, sonarqube_hotspots_new
FROM sprint_metrics
ORDER BY sprint_number DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Aggregate metrics into the sprint-file frontmatter:**

Extend `journal/sprint-{date}.md` frontmatter (in addition to existing fields):

```yaml
---
sprint: 12
stories: [BOO-15, BOO-16, BOO-17]
metrics:
  eslint_iterations_avg: 2.3
  eslint_recurring_rules:
    - "no-unused-vars (4x)"
    - "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps (3x)"
  semgrep_findings_total: 0
  coverage_trend: "82% -> 84% (+2pp)"
  pre_flight_warnings_count: 1
  ci_failures_top5:
    - "BOO-15: SonarQube hotspot in auth.ts"
  sonarqube_hotspots_new: 1
  sonarqube_hotspots_resolved: 3
  sonarqube_cognitive_complexity_trend: "stable"
  # BOO-84 token-efficiency metrics (all optional, empty when hook not active)
  cost_breakdown:
    total_cost_usd: 1.23
    stories_with_token_data: 3
    stories_without_token_data: 0
    cache_hit_rate_avg: 0.78
    override_count_total: 0
    tier_breakdown:
      - tier: haiku
        input_tokens: 45000
        output_tokens: 8000
      - tier: sonnet
        input_tokens: 85000
        output_tokens: 18000
      - tier: opus
        input_tokens: 12000
        output_tokens: 4000
---
```

**What sprint review additionally detects:**

- Recurring iteration patterns: "ESLint rule X blocked in 4 out of 5 stories"
- Coverage drift across multiple sprints
- CI failure patterns (which checks fail most often)
- Token pre-flight warnings (BOO-40): when the operator regularly proceeded despite warnings → calibration input for BOO-39

Results flow into step 6 (report) and step 8 (learning loop) — e.g. when ESLint rule X failed 4×, lesson "consider ESLint rule X as a custom rule for the skill generator".

### Step 3: Tech-debt inventory

- Identify code duplication (same functions in multiple files)
- Hardcoded values that belong in `lib/config.js`
- Deprecated features not yet removed
- Count and assess open code markers (unfinished spots, workarounds, TODOs)
- Stale dependencies or outdated API versions

### Step 4: Backlog hygiene

- Orphaned issues (referenced issues that don't exist)
- Issues without dependencies that should have some
- Obsolete issues (superseded by other work)
- Missing issues (tech debt without a ticket)
- Priorities still up-to-date?

### Step 5: Process compliance

- Do all recent issues have the mandatory template?
- Were dependencies documented bidirectionally?
- Are all doc files on the same VERSION (`lib/config.js` vs. DOC_FILES)?
- Were Obsidian change logs written?
- Are component docs (Obsidian or `docs/components/`) up-to-date for all active components?
- Are all new `*.md` files registered in `ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md §9`? (orphan-check)

### Step 6: Report + actions

Present to the operator:
- **Summary**: 3–5 sentences, overall assessment
- **Top 3 risks**: what should be tackled next?
- **Tech-debt score**: low / medium / high
- **Recommended issues**: new stories for identified tech debt
- **Backlog cleanup**: issues to close/adjust

### Step 7: Anti-Pattern Self-Diagnosis (BOO-26)

> Reads `code-crash-framework/references/anti-pattern-katalog.en.md` and asks a brief Yes/No/Unclear question per AP.
> No hard block — this step is reflection, not a gate.
> Duration: approx. 5 minutes.

**Technical APs (Process + Quality — skill-detectable):**

| AP | Diagnostic question | Yes/No/Unclear |
|----|---------------------|----------------|
| AP1 Tool chaos | More than 2 different AI coding tools in use — without central evaluation? | |
| AP2 Review overload | Did PR reviews regularly take >24h in the last sprint? | |
| AP3 Feature inflation | Were features built without intent-linkage — just because they were "quick to do"? | |
| AP4 Security as finish line | Are security checks done as the last step before deployment rather than in the pipeline? | |
| AP5 Technical debt in turbo mode | Are duplication rates or conflicting architecture patterns rising in the code? | |
| AP6 Experience debt | Were features shipped without a UX/design review — "design comes later"? | |
| AP8 Speed without system | More than 1 rollback in the last sprint due to missing tests or observability? | |
| AP10 Slopware | More features than previous sprints — but declining outcome measurement? | |

**Culture APs (reflection only — not skill-detectable):**

| AP | Diagnostic question | Yes/No/Unclear |
|----|---------------------|----------------|
| AP7 Responsibility diffusion | Did anyone say "the AI did it that way" when something went wrong? | |
| AP9 Individual-first as isolation | Is there duplicate work because architecture decisions were not shared? | |
| AP11 Political saboteurs | Is there a pattern of systematic blockers from the same people? | |

**Evaluation:**
- **All No:** No acute AP problem — brief note in learning loop
- **1-2 Yes/Unclear:** Entry in sprint retro with concrete countermeasure from `anti-pattern-katalog.en.md`
- **3+ Yes/Unclear:** Propose an ADR (`docs/domain/adrs/`) + issue in backlog for the countermeasure

Full symptoms + countermeasures: `code-crash-framework/references/anti-pattern-katalog.en.md`

### Step 8: Learning-loop entry (mandatory if learning loop active)

> **Activation:** this step only runs if `{PROJECT_PATH}/.learning-loop` exists (contents: `L1`, `L2` or `L3`).
> If the file is missing: the skill skips step 7 and ends after step 6.

The learning loop captures systematically **three categories**: what worked, what didn't work, next experiment. Details see `bootstrap/references/learning-loop.en.md`.

#### Level L1 — Simple (learnings.md)

The skill asks:
```
Sprint review complete. Now the learning-loop entry:

1. WHAT WORKED in this period? (3 bullets, with story link if relevant)
2. WHAT DIDN'T WORK (+ root cause if known)? (3 bullets)
3. NEXT EXPERIMENT / CHANGE? (3 bullets, concrete and measurable)
```

The skill appends the entry with a date header to:
- `{PROJECT_PATH}/journal/learnings.md`
- If Obsidian active: mirror in `{OBSIDIAN_VAULT}/04 Ressourcen/{PROJECT_NAME}/learnings.md`

Commit: `docs: sprint-review learnings {TODAY}`

#### Level L2 — Structured (sprint journal)

The skill prepares frontmatter from git log + backlog API (sprint number, story counts, velocity, period).

The skill asks the 4 qualitative sections:
1. What worked (with tag list)
2. What didn't (+ root cause, with tag list)
3. Next experiment (idea + measurement criterion + assigned story)
4. Learnings for upcoming sprints (meta rules)

The skill saves:
- Primary: `{PROJECT_PATH}/journal/sprint-{YYYY-MM-XX}.md` with full frontmatter
- Mirror (if Obsidian active): `{OBSIDIAN_VAULT}/04 Ressourcen/{PROJECT_NAME}/sprints/sprint-{YYYY-MM-XX}.md`

Commit: `docs: sprint-retro {SPRINT_NUMBER} ({TODAY})`

**Quarterly meta-retro:** on every 4th sprint review, the skill consolidates the last 4 sprint retros and writes `{PROJECT_PATH}/journal/quarterly-{YYYY-QX}.md` with trends, top anti-patterns, successful experiments.

#### Level L3 — SQLite + MD (only when active)

In addition to L2:
- Parse the L2 frontmatter + bullets
- Insert into `{PROJECT_PATH}/journal/learnings.db` via `journal/write_sprint.py`
- Tables: `sprints`, `events`, `metrics`, `experiments` (schema see `bootstrap/references/learning-loop.en.md`)

The skill optionally asks for additional metrics (e.g. `avg_story_time_days`, `api_cost_total`).

### Conclusion

After step 8 (or step 7 if learning loop inactive):

```
Sprint review complete.

Report:
  - Architecture: {n} OK / {n} warnings / {n} critical
  - Tech debt: {score}
  - Backlog cleanup: {n} recommendations
  - Anti-pattern self-diagnosis: {n} Yes hits — {action}
  - Learning loop: {level} → {n} entries saved

Commits:
  - sprint-review report (if saved as MD)
  - learnings entry (step 8)

Next steps:
  1. Review recommended issues in backlog
  2. Quarterly meta-retro if sprint number % 4 == 0
```

## Integration with other skills

- **`/ideation`** reads the last 3 learning-loop entries at every story creation (step 0.5) and warns on anti-pattern match.
- **`/architecture-review --system`** can run the sprint review at system scope (all active dimensions).
- **`/breakfix`** writes breakfix learnings into the loop in parallel as `what_didnt` with root cause.

## Triggers

- Operator says: "sprint review", "architecture audit", "tech debt", "clean up", "retro"
- Slash command: `/sprint-review`
- Cron (optional): weekly / monthly — sends reminder: "time for sprint-review"
- After every 4th sprint: quarterly meta-retro trigger

## Configuration

Learning-loop activation: `{PROJECT_PATH}/.learning-loop` file with contents `L1`, `L2` or `L3`. Created in bootstrap block D.4 or later manually.
