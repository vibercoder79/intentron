# Data Protection Officer

Privacy by Design for Claude Code — from data collection to deletion.

## Principles (Art. 5 GDPR)

Every processing of personal data MUST satisfy these principles:

| Principle | Meaning | Probing Question |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Lawfulness** | Legal basis required | Which Art. 6(1) letter applies? |
| **Purpose Limitation** | Only for the specified purpose | What exactly are the data collected for? |
| **Data Minimisation** | Only what is necessary | Do we really need ALL these fields? |
| **Accuracy** | Data must be correct | Are there update mechanisms? |
| **Storage Limitation** | Delete when no longer necessary | When are the data deleted? |
| **Integrity & Confidentiality** | Appropriate protection (→ Security Architect) | Are TOMs defined? |
| **Accountability** | Must be able to demonstrate compliance | Is everything documented? |

---

## 3 Modes

### Mode Selection (automatic)

```
User plans new feature with data?         → ASSESS
User changes code with data processing?   → REVIEW
User says "privacy audit"?                → AUDIT
Another skill calls DPO?                  → ASSESS or REVIEW (depending on phase)
```

---

### ASSESS Mode (Data Protection Impact Assessment)

**When:** At ideation, planning, new features — BEFORE personal data are processed.

**Workflow:**

1. **Data flow analysis**
   - Which personal data are collected?
   - Determine categories:

   | Category | Examples | Sensitivity |
   |-----------|-----------|---------------|
   | Master Data | Name, address, date of birth | Standard |
   | Contact Data | E-mail, phone | Standard |
   | Usage Data | IP, logs, click behaviour | Standard |
   | Financial Data | IBAN, credit card, transactions | Elevated |
   | Health Data | Diagnoses, medication | Special (Art. 9) |
   | Biometric Data | Fingerprint, face recognition | Special (Art. 9) |
   | Location Data | GPS, movement profiles | Elevated |
   | Minors | Data of under-16s | Special (Art. 8) |

   - Where do the data come from? (Directly from user, from third parties, automatically collected)
   - Where do they flow? (Internal, processor, third countries)

2. **Determine legal basis (Art. 6(1) GDPR)**

   | Letter | Legal Basis | Typical Use |
   |-----------|----------------|-------------------|
   | a) | **Consent** | Newsletter, tracking, cookies |
   | b) | **Contract performance** | Order processing, account management |
   | c) | **Legal obligation** | Tax retention, reporting obligations |
   | d) | **Vital interests** | Emergency contact (rare) |
   | e) | **Public interest** | Authorities, research |
   | f) | **Legitimate interest** | Fraud protection, direct marketing (with balancing test!) |

   For Art. 9 data (special categories): additionally check Art. 9(2).

3. **Conduct DPIA (Art. 35 GDPR)**
   DPIA MANDATORY when:
   - Scoring/profiling with legal effect
   - Automated decisions
   - Systematic monitoring of public areas
   - Processing special categories on a large scale
   - Combining datasets
   - Data of vulnerable persons (children, employees)
   - New technologies (AI, biometrics)

   → [references/dpia-template.en.md](references/dpia-template.en.md)

4. **Check third country transfer**
   - Data to USA/UK/other third countries?
   - Adequacy decision in place? (e.g. EU-US Data Privacy Framework)
   - If not: Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) + Transfer Impact Assessment
   - Cloud providers: where are the servers?

**Output:** Privacy assessment with:
- Data inventory (what data, what category)
- Legal basis per processing purpose
- DPIA (if required)
- Third country transfer assessment
- Concrete requirements for implementation

---

### REVIEW Mode (Privacy Check on Code Changes)

**When:** On code changes that affect personal data.

**Workflow:**

1. **Check data minimisation**
   - Are only the fields collected that are needed for the purpose?
   - Are data aggregated/pseudonymised where possible?
   - No unnecessary storage in logs, caches, analytics?

2. **Check consent implementation** (if consent = legal basis)
   ```
   Checklist:
   - [ ] Consent obtained BEFORE data collection
   - [ ] Freely given (no coupling-prohibition violation)
   - [ ] Informed (purpose, recipients, duration named)
   - [ ] Specific (for each purpose separately)
   - [ ] Withdrawable (as easy as granting)
   - [ ] Provable (timestamp + version stored)
   - [ ] No pre-checked checkbox
   - [ ] Double opt-in for e-mail marketing
   ```

3. **Check data subject rights**
   → [references/betroffenenrechte.en.md](references/betroffenenrechte.en.md)

   | Right | Art. | Implemented? |
   |-------|------|----------------|
   | Access | 15 | Can the user export all their data? |
   | Rectification | 16 | Can the user change their data? |
   | Erasure | 17 | Can the user request deletion? |
   | Restriction | 18 | Can processing be restricted? |
   | Data portability | 20 | Export in machine-readable format (JSON/CSV)? |
   | Objection | 21 | Opt-out for legitimate interest? |
   | Automated decisions | 22 | Right to human review? |

4. **Check deletion policy**
   - Are there defined retention periods?
   - Are data automatically deleted after expiry?
   - Are backups considered in the deletion policy?
   - Are derived data (analytics, ML models) also deleted?

5. **Privacy by Design Patterns**
   → [references/privacy-patterns.en.md](references/privacy-patterns.en.md)

**Output:** Privacy review report

```
### Privacy Review: [Feature/Change]

| # | Finding | Severity | Regulation | Recommendation |
|---|--------|---------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | E-mail logged without consent | HIGH | Art. 5/6 GDPR | Remove logging or obtain consent |
| 2 | No deletion mechanism for user data | HIGH | Art. 17 GDPR | Implement DELETE endpoint |
| 3 | Missing privacy notice for new feature | MEDIUM | Art. 13 GDPR | Update notice |

**Compliance Status:** NOT COMPLIANT / PARTIALLY COMPLIANT / COMPLIANT
**Blocker:** Yes (HIGH findings must be resolved before release)
```

---

### AUDIT Mode (Compliance Audit)

**When:** On demand ("/dpo audit"), before releases, periodically, on supervisory authority requests.

AUDIT mode is **catalogue-driven and deterministic**: instead of a free-form LLM assessment, a
runner works through the versioned control catalogues under `dpo/controls/*.yml`. Same project
state = same result — reproducible and Git-traceable.

**Workflow:**

1. **Work through the catalogues (deterministic runner)**

   The runner reads the framework catalogues `dpo/controls/*.yml` (`gdpr`, `ndsg`,
   optionally `nist-ai-600`) plus an optional **project overlay** under
   `.claude/dpo/controls/` (`.yml` + `.json`) and executes each control check mechanically:

   ```bash
   DPO_PROJECT_ROOT=. python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/dpo-audit.py
   ```

   (`<skill-dir>` is this skill's directory. The call is dependency-free —
   pure python3 stdlib, no PyYAML, no database.)

2. **Report is generated deterministically**

   The runner writes the report pair under `dpo/reports/`:
   - `dpo/reports/<date>_audit.md` — human-readable: pass/gap table, fix hint per GAP (`mapsTo`)
   - `dpo/reports/<date>_audit.json` — machine-readable: the same data, structured

   Each row carries the control ID, title, `quelle` (GDPR/nDSG article as audit evidence), status and detail.

3. **Honest determinism — mechanical vs. judgement**

   The runner cleanly separates two classes of checks and does NOT fake full automation:

   | Check class | check_typ | Result | Who decides |
   |-------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
   | **Mechanical** | `file-exists`, `file-contains`, `grep-absent` | **PASS / GAP** (reproducible) | Machine |
   | **Judgement** | `review` (purpose limitation, proportionality, third country, DPA) | **REVIEW-NEEDED** | Operator/skill — manually afterwards |

   Mechanical checks return PASS/GAP reproducibly. Judgement checks deliberately return
   **REVIEW-NEEDED** — the operator (or the skill afterwards) works these off using the
   guiding questions below and records the outcome back into the report. No invented legal
   advice — the skill poses the probing question, the operator decides.

4. **REVIEW-NEEDED guiding questions (bound to control IDs)**

   The existing substantive checkpoints remain as guiding questions — they are now each bound to
   a control ID and surfaced into the report via the `review` type:

   - **Records of Processing Activities (Art. 30)** — `GDPR-Art30-001`, `NDSG-Art12-001`
     → [references/verarbeitungsverzeichnis.en.md](references/verarbeitungsverzeichnis.en.md)
     Per processing activity: designation/purpose, categories of data subjects and data,
     recipients (internal + external), third country transfers, retention periods, TOMs (→ Security Architect).
   - **Information duties (Art. 13/14)** — `GDPR-Art13-001`, `NDSG-Art19-001`
     Privacy notice complete/up to date? All purposes and legal bases named?
     Data subject rights explained? Contact details of controller/DPO?
   - **Legal basis & purpose limitation (Art. 6 / Art. 5)** — `GDPR-Art6-001`, `GDPR-Art5-001`, `GDPR-Art5-002`
     Does each processing have a legal basis? A fixed, documented purpose? Is data minimisation met?
   - **Processor agreements (Art. 28)** — `GDPR-Art28-001`
     All service providers with DPA captured? Sub-processors documented? Instruction-bound nature?
   - **Third country transfer (nDSG effects principle)** — `NDSG-Art16-001`
     Transfers checked against the Federal Council country list? Proportionality?
   - **TOMs (Art. 32 / nDSG Art. 8)** — `GDPR-Art32-001`, `GDPR-Art32-002`, `NDSG-Art8-001`
     Encryption at rest/in transit, pseudonymisation, access control, backup, regular testing
     (→ Security Architect). The secret/TLS checks already run mechanically here as `grep-absent`.

**Output:** The deterministic report pair `dpo/reports/<date>_audit.{md,json}` —
pass/gap table with fix hints and the open REVIEW-NEEDED list for the operator.

> An **OSCAL export** of the results is planned as an optional later build stage (not part of this
> story). Determinism comes from the versioned Git YAML catalogues — deliberately NO database.

---

## Control Catalogues

AUDIT mode is fed by flat, versioned YAML catalogues. Each control is a mapping with a fixed schema:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `id` | Control ID (e.g. `GDPR-Art30-001`) |
| `titel` | Plain-text label |
| `evidenz` | Required evidence |
| `check_typ` | `file-exists` \| `file-contains` \| `grep-absent` \| `review` |
| `check_arg` | `file-exists` → path · `file-contains` → `path::needle` · `grep-absent` → regex (GAP if found in source) · `review` → empty |
| `mapsTo` | Reference to check/artefact/fix hint |
| `quelle` | **Mandatory** — origin (GDPR/nDSG article), audit evidence |
| `ergebnis` | set during the run (PASS \| GAP \| REVIEW-NEEDED), empty in the catalogue |

**Framework catalogues** (`dpo/controls/`):

| Catalogue | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| `gdpr.yml` | GDPR controls (Art. 5/6/13/17/28/30/32) |
| `ndsg.yml` | Swiss nDSG controls (Art. 8/12/16/19/22/24/25) — CH differentiator |
| `nist-ai-600.yml` | optional, for AI processing |
| `optional/eu-ai-act.yml` | EU AI Act (Reg. (EU) 2024/1689) — risk class, transparency, human oversight, logging, GPAI. **Not auto-loaded** (lives under `controls/optional/`): copied into the project overlay by the EU AI Act add-on (BOO-105) and only loaded then; checks `AI_SYSTEM.md` |

**Project overlay (BYO framework):** A project can place its own catalogues under
`.claude/dpo/controls/` (`.yml` + `.json`, same schema). The runner automatically merges them
with the framework catalogues. This way project-specific controls survive a framework update —
they live in the project repo, not in the skill.

## Country-Specific Regulations

### GDPR/DSGVO (EU) — Baseline

GDPR is the foundation. All checks are based primarily on it.

### BDSG (Germany) — Additions

| Topic | BDSG Particularity |
|-------|-------------------|
| DPO obligation | From 20 persons with regular data processing (§ 38) |
| Employee data protection | § 26 BDSG — own legal basis |
| Video surveillance | § 4 BDSG — stricter rules |
| Scoring | § 31 BDSG — additional requirements |
| Fines | Up to EUR 50,000 for administrative offences (in addition to GDPR) |

### nDSG (Switzerland) — Differences

→ [references/ndsg-schweiz.en.md](references/ndsg-schweiz.en.md)

| Topic | nDSG Particularity |
|-------|-------------------|
| Scope | Effects principle — also applies to Swiss data abroad |
| DPIA | "Datenschutz-Folgenabschaetzung" — similar, but DPO can be consulted instead of authority |
| Reporting obligation | "As soon as possible" to EDOEB (no 72h limit like GDPR) |
| Criminal law | Fines up to CHF 250,000 against **natural persons** (not companies!) |
| Right of access | Within 30 days (GDPR: "without undue delay", in practice 1 month) |
| Profiling | "Profiling with high risk" requires consent or law |
| Data transfer | Country list by Federal Council (not EU adequacy decisions) |

---

## Integration with Other Skills

| Calling Skill | DPO Mode | What Happens |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Ideation** | ASSESS | Privacy assessment parallel to the story |
| **Implement** | REVIEW | Check data processing in code |
| **Security Architect** | Bidirectional | Security → provides TOMs; DPO → defines protection requirement |
| **Sprint Review** | AUDIT | Periodic privacy compliance check |

### Interplay Security Architect ↔ DPO

```
Security Architect                    DPO
       |                               |
  "What protection level?" ←──────── "Art. 9 data = HIGH"
       |                               |
  "TOMs: AES-256, RBAC,    ────────→ "TOMs for Art. 32
   Backup, Monitoring"                 documented ✓"
```
